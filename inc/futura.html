		<h2>FUTURA - LUCCA, GUAMO</h2>
<p>Futura is driven by a passion for technology. But more than technology for its own sake. Futura’s leadership in the field is based on the belief that every component of a tissue converting line should be designed with the most efficient equipment operation, all-round safety, ultimate flexibility and maximum ease of use and maintenance in mind, not to mention substantial waste reduction.</p>

<p>In just over a decade, the company has taken tissue converting to new levels of operating ease and efficiency for both consumer and professional lines. This achievement owes much to our clients’ experience and vision. But it is also a result of numerous innovative solutions which draw on the design philosophy of Fabio Perini, Futura’s President.</p>

<p>To create value, Futura responds to customer needs in ways which are not only practical, but inspirational. Since entering the market, Futura has systematically redesigned and rebranded every component of the classic converting line. The key converting functions of unwinding, printing, embossing, rewinding and cutting, and the coremaking system, have been totally remodelled from the ground up, bringing considerable benefits which are widely appreciated in the market.</p>

<p>The revolutionary JOI embosser is a striking symbol of Futura’s transformational influence on tissue converting. The flexibility it has brought to what was previously the most complex of converting phases has allowed clients to rethink their whole operation for the better.</p>

<p>Innovation and refinement are ongoing processes at Futura’s dedicated research and development facility in Lucca – FuturaLab – where new concepts are also rigorously tested. Futura holds more than 70 patents.</p>

<p>Particular attention has also been focused on our Procare service division, which has recently introduced ProTablet. This new documentation system allows users to view 3D maintenance video procedures wherever and whenever necessary. It also gives access to exploded views, procedure search by means of barcode, manuals and diagrams. In its latest version, it offers an overview of the complete tissue manufacturing process. A single tool, always up to date.</p>

<p>Futura is led by CEO Fabio Boschi and staffed by a dedicated team of around 130 employees at its headquarters and production facility in Lucca, Italy, and its Sales & Service centres in Alpharetta, USA, and Joinville, Brazil.</p>

<p>Futura puts its heart and soul into creating a better experience for tissue converters.</p>
